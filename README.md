## Features

* Over 60 handcrafted **Filters** covering all state of the art style- and mood settings to choose from. 
* Design custom filters in Photoshop and other apps: The API of the PhotoEditor SDK enables you to expand the filter library with your own set of custom filters to define a unique visual language. Custom filters can easily be created by anyone using LUTs (Lookup Tables) from popular apps like Photoshop, GIMP or Lightroom. Design your filter and apply it onto the provided identity image. That will 'record' the filter response, now simply save it and add it as a new filter. Done. 
* An **Overlay** Tool that can be used to create neat lighting effects like lens flare or bokeh but also to furnish pictures with textures like crumpled paper or plaster. You can easily expand the library by importing your own set of overlay assets.  
* An **Adjustment section** that holds both essential and advanced photo editing features like brightness, contrast, saturation, clarity etc. that help tweak and fine tune images to create stunning creatives. 
* A **Transform section** that unifies cropping, flipping and rotation in one feature.  
* The robust **Text Feature** provides all necessary functions for quickly adding text to any picture or creative. The corresponding font library can easily be exchanged, reduced, or expanded.
* A categorized **Sticker library** whose UI is optimized for exploration and discovery. You can easily complement the library with your own custom sticker packages.
* A **Frame Tool** that works with any given photo size or ratio.   
* A high performant **Brush Engine** optimized for touch screen that supports different brush strokes.  
* A **Photo Roll** equipped with a wide range of stock photography and templates with presorted categories. The API allows for easy expansion, reduction and rearrangement of the assets. 
* A clean and intuitive **UI** that ensures an unhindered flow of creativity and a seamless experience while composing creatives. The UI is designed to be customized to completely match your CI and blend with your app. 
* You can strip out every feature you deem unnecessary to provide your users with the exact feature set your use case requires.
